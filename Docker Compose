Docker Compose
==============
The docker compose file is a dictionary with a list of services.
Define your application in yaml files.

To create you compose file use  key value pairs in yaml format.
 > The minimum specification is an image.
    =  image: <name of repo = hub user>/<name of app>


To run: bring up the entire stack use:

  docker compose up

However you must add the port mapping or no one else can access the application.
 > must specify a ports property.

Example file from previous page's examples.

docker-compose.yml
-----------------------------
services:
     web:
        image: <name of repo = hub user>/<name of app>
        ports:
             - "80:5000"
                (external port: internal port)

     database:
         image: "mysql"

         volumes:
              - /opt/data:/var/lib/mysql
          (local host directory:directory inside container)

-----------------------------

docker-compose up  - brings up the entire stack

docker-compose stop - stops the containers

docker-compose down - stops everything and removes the containers entirely
